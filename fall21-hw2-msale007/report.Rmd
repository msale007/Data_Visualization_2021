CS 625, Fall 2021

### Part 1. Data Cleaning
The data set consists of 1783 rows and the 5 columns:

By looking at the data we can see a lot of errors like:
  - Spell check
  - Repeated Names
  - Lower case and Upper case
  - Extra symbols

#### Step1: (Cleaning "what kind of pet is this" column)

Then I applied different methods and keying functions to edit the column.

![alt text here](Pictures/Picture7.png)

![alt text here](Pictures/Picture8.png)

![alt text here](Pictures/Picture9.png)

Then: Edit cells –\> Cluster and Edit –\> key collision

![alt text here](Pictures/Picture10.png)

Then I found that Bunny is in Rabbit category. The same is with Tortoise and Turtle, Gecko and Lizard, So I replaced them as follow:

![alt text here](Pictures/Picture11.png)

Also Beta fish and Goldfish are in the Fish category, so I replaced them with Fish.

Then manually did this:

#### \*Kitten replaced with Cat
#### \*Kitty replaced with Cat
#### \*Puppy replaced with Dog
#### \*Other: prairie dog supposed Other
#### \*Dog, dog, dog , cat supposed Dog
#### \*Leopard Lizard replaced with Lizard

At the end I found that there are some blank cells in this column and I decided to remove them:

![alt text here](Pictures/Picture14.png)

At the end of first step I ended up with 1781 rows and 32 choices for "what kind of pet is this" column.

#### Step2: (Cleaning up "Pet`s age" column)

First I went to Facet –\> Numeric facet to check the range of all pets. We can see that it`s 0-25.

![alt text here](Pictures/Picture15.png)

Only Non-numeric should be checked:

![alt text here](Pictures/Picture16.png)

Then I went to Pet`s age, Edit cells, Transform and I applied this:

``` p
value.replace("1/2",".5").replace("½",".5").replace(",","").replace("~","").replace("?","").replace("ish","").replace("old","")
```

![alt text here](Pictures/Picture17.png)

After each time I made a changes in this column I checked to see all the data is numeric:

![alt text here](Pictures/Picture18.png)

Then I found some misspelling and errors and  some extra words and I fixed them. Also there was inconsistency in the data (week,month,year) and I decided to convert all of them to year scale.

``` p
toNumber(value.replace("months","").replace("mos","").replace("mo","").replace("Months",""))/12.0

```

![alt text here](Pictures/Picture19.png)

``` p
toNumber(value.replace("weeks","").replace("week",""))/52.0

```

![alt text here](Pictures/Picture20.png)
``` p
value.replace("years","").replace("yesrs","").replace("year","")
```
![alt text here](Pictures/Picture22.png)

``` p
value.replace(" .5",".5").replace("about","").replace("About","").replace("Almost","").replace("+","").replace("Two","2").replace("Six","6")
```

![alt text here](Pictures/Picture23.png)

``` p
value.replace("approx.","").replace("(approx)","").replace("yrs","").replace("y","")
```

![alt text here](Pictures/Picture24.png)


![alt text here](Pictures/Picture25.png)

At the end I removed all the other not numeric values:

![alt text here](Pictures/Picture26.png)

![alt text here](Pictures/Picture27.png)

#### Step3: (Cleaning up "Pet`s breed" column)

First I searched to see how many choices exists for this column so I went to
Pet`s breed, Facet, Text facet. We can see that at the beginning there are 702 choices for it:

![alt text here](Pictures/Picture28.png)

Then I cleaned the data the same way I did for Pet`s kinds, as follows:

![alt text here](Pictures/Picture29.png)

![alt text here](Pictures/Picture31.png)

![alt text here](Pictures/Picture32.png)

![alt text here](Pictures/Picture33.png)

![alt text here](Pictures/Picture34.png)

![alt text here](Pictures/Picture35.png)

![alt text here](Pictures/Picture36.png)

![alt text here](Pictures/Picture37.png)

![alt text here](Pictures/Picture38.png)

![alt text here](Pictures/Picture39.png)

![alt text here](Pictures/Picture40.png)
