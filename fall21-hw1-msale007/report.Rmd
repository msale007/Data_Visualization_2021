## Git, GitHub

1. *What is your GitHub username?*
msale007 

2. *What is the URL of your remote GitHub repo (created through Mr. Kennedy's exercises)?*

<https://github.com/msale007/Myrepo-.git>



## R

The command below will load the tidyverse package.  If you have installed R, RStudio, and the tidyverse package, it should display a list of loaded packages and their versions
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## R Markdown 

1. *Create a bulleted list with at least 3 items*

* First item
* Second item
* Third item


2. *Write a single paragraph that demonstrates the use of italics, bold, bold italics, code, and includes a link. The paragraph does not have to make sense.*

This is **first** line. Here is the **second** line. This *text* is really important. ***In this sentence I have used bold and italic together.*** In the next section type `LINES OF MY CODE`. Here is the link to see the [full text](https://fulltext.com)

3. *Create a level 3 heading*

### Heading level 3


## R 

#### Data Visualization Exercises

1. (Q2) *How many rows are in mpg? How many columns?*

234 rows and 11 columns

1. (Q4) *Make a scatterplot of hwy vs cyl.*

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = hwy, y = cyl))
```



#### Workflow: basics Exercises

1. (Q2) *Tweak each of the following R commands so that they run correctly (`library(tidyverse)` is correct):*

```r
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(dota = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
fliter(mpg, cyl = 8)
filter(diamond, carat > 3)
```
`ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))`
typo mistake: dota changed to data

`filter(mpg, cyl == 8)`
'=' replaced with '=='
Filter typo mistake

`filter(diamonds, carat > 3)`
"diamond" replaced with diamonds

## Google Colab

1. *What are the URLs of your Google Colab notebooks (both Python and R)?*

[Google Colab URL](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1KLX6zVpzqbDN66Ota8Z-KKF6S5siaYyS?usp=sharing)
[ Practice exercises in Section 4.4.](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1N2WSA3CBQyQ3OCTN7R84PRzedPSAl8im)

## Tableau

*Insert your the image of your final bar chart here*
![Final bar chart](C:/ODU/Fall2021/DataVisualisation/HWs/HW1/Sales-in-the-Central.jpg)

1. *What conclusions can you draw from the chart?*

Over the time in the central region, the profit in technology goes higher, especially for phones while the profit for office supplies got negative.

## Observable and Vega-Lite
 
### A Taste of Observable

1. *In the "New York City weather forecast" section, try replacing `Forecast: detailedForecast` with `Forecast: shortForecast`. Then press the blue play button  or use Shift-Return to run your change. What happens?*

In the forecast section, there is short forecast instead of detail forecast.

1. *Under the scatterplot of temperature vs. name, try replacing `markCircle()` with `markSquare()`. Then press the blue play button  or use Shift-Return to run your change. What happens? How about `markPoint()`?*

In the plot there would be squares instead of circles when we use `markSquare()` and there would be points(empty circles) instead of circles when I use `markPoint()`.

1. *Under "Pick a location, see the weather forecast", pick a location on the map.  Where was the point you picked near?*

Kapowsin, WA.

1. *The last visualization on this page is a "fancy" weather chart embedded from another notebook.  Click on the 3 dots next to that chart and choose 'Download PNG'.  Insert the PNG into your report.*

### Charting with Vega-Lite

`markCircle()`

1. *Pass an option of `{ size: 200 }` to `markCircle()`.*
The size of circles increased (200 times larger)
1. *Try `markSquare` instead of `markCircle`.*
Circles are replaced by squares 
1. *Try `markPoint({ shape: 'diamond' })`.*
Empty diamonds plotted instead of filled circles

`vl.x().fieldQ("Horsepower")`, ..

1. *Change `Horsepower` to `Acceleration`*
There is a new plot when x is Acceleration and y is Miles_per_Gallon.  
1. *Swap what fields are displayed on the x- and y-axis*
If swap the axis the plot shape rotated 90 degree and mirrored.
`vl.tooltip().fieldN("Name")`

1. *Change `Name` to `Origin`.*
Nothing changed.

Another example, `count()`

1. *Remove the `vl.y().fieldN("Origin")` line.*
There would be just one bar chart.
1. *Replace `count()` with `average("Miles_per_Gallon")`.*
The values for each bar changed.
